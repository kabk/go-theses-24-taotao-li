			<h2 id="Abstract">00: Abstract</h2>

			<p>During the four years at the Royal Academy of Arts The Hague (KABK),
				I came to the realization that my passion lies in the realm of type and
				moving image. The vivid imagery of Hong Kong neon signs adorned with a
				fusion of illustrative Chinese calligraphy and Latin words, illuminating
				the urban night in various captivating ways, constantly occupies my
				mind. I wished to understand the hidden meanings behind color, symbols,
				patterns, moving methods of neon signs in Hong Kong. I wanted to know
				why, when neon signs are so highly valued in Hong Kong, the craft is
				still fading. I wanted to study why neon signs can make an impact in
				visual culture. These neon signs establish iconic sceneries, leaving a
				profound visual imprint with their dazzling and colourful presence on
				people.</p>
			<p>This thesis delves into the developmental history of Hong Kong's neon
				signs, examining why these neon signs have evolved into a distinctive
				visual culture globally recognized from both visual and cultural
				perspectives. Additionally, the research delves into the intricate
				craftsmanship underlying neon sign production, the rationale governing
				visual synthesis, the interplay between Hong Kong's identity and neon
				signs, and the consequential cultural influence wielded by these neon
				signs.</p>

			<h2 id="Introduction">01: Introduction</h2>

			<p>Neon signs are crafted from glass tubes filled with gas. Skilled
				artisans heat and manipulate the glass, creating diverse shapes that
				illuminate as the gas reacts to electrical energy. This soft and dynamic
				glow enjoyed widespread popularity in 20th-century Hong Kong.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
					id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> While neon lights originally hailed
				from the West, Hong Kong's colonial past facilitated the integration of
				this technology.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Over
				several decades of evolution,
				Hong Kong's neon signs have transformed into a cultural hallmark. These
				distinctive, large neon signs, nestled within the unique urban landscape
				of Hong Kong, boast varied sizes, shapes, font combinations, and a
				spectrum of colours. Their rhythmic animated displays and the gentle
				radiance of neon lights collectively produce a highly identifiable
				visual spectacle. This iconic cityscape has found its way into numerous
				films, photography projects, and visual arts, becoming a symbol that
				captures the vibrancy, opulence, confidence, and fragility of the modern
				urban experience. Simultaneously, within the realm of cyberpunk sci-fi,
				this visual motif appears as an element in depicting a future dystopian
				city, offering the unique visual image – neon signs diverse
				interpretations and cultural significance.</p>
			<p>As new technologies, such as LED lights, emerge with lower costs and
				shorter production cycles, neon signs are gradually being supplanted.
				Despite intentional governmental efforts to preserve them, neon signs
				still face an inevitable trend of decline.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
					role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> In
				the ongoing process of urban modernization, striking a balance between
				the imperative to protect these cultural artifacts and the developmental
				need of the city becomes particularly crucial.</p>
			<p>To better achieve this goal, it is essential to understand the
				emotional and cultural connections between the citizens living under
				these neon signs and these iconic displays. From an economic
				perspective, exploring how the presence and evolution of neon signs
				impact Hong Kong's socio-economic landscape is vital. This exploration
				may encompass their roles in attracting tourism, shaping the distinctive
				characteristics of different communities, and fostering the overall
				economic vitality of the city.</p>
			<p>From an urban planning standpoint, it is crucial to analyse the role
				of neon signs in city planning and design. Consider how neon signs
				contribute to the visual identity of various regions and explore
				existing regulations or policies governing the integration of neon
				signages with the cityscape. Only through a comprehensive consideration
				of the myriad real-world factors influencing neon signs can we hope to
				better protect and ensure the enduring sustainability of these beautiful
				neon signs.</p>

			<!-- <summary>
				<ol id="chapter-1.1">1. The background of neon signs in Hong Kong</ol>
			</summary> -->

			<p>Neon light was discovered in 1893 by Serbian American inventor Nikola
				Tesla, but he didn't file for a patent. William Ramsay found that rare
				gases, when electrified in discharge lamps, produce distinct and vibrant
				colours. Later Georges Claude tweaked the design originally crafted by
				Daniel McFarlan Moore, ironed out some practical engineering issues, and
				secured a patent for the neon light in 1910.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
					role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
				After flourishing in western nations, neon lights sailed across the seas
				and found their way to China. The first neon sign was installed at the
				Shanghai Central Hostel (上海中央大旅社) in China. It’s made by the
				Shanghai Far East Chemistry Company (上海远东化学制造厂) in 1927.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
					role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> During the decade, the neon industry
				in Shanghai thrived, expanding across the country, and reaching coastal
				cities. Yet, due to the political turmoil sparked by the Japanese
				invasion of China in 1937 and the ensuing internal conflicts, numerous
				neon light manufacturers moved their operations from Shanghai to Hong
				Kong.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> This shift
				involved the transfer of
				capital, human resources, skills, and knowledge. In the 1950s, Hong
				Kong's neon industry was booming, with a vibrant market showcasing
				intricate neon designs. Neon technology had advanced considerably
				progress, enabling the creation of complex shapes, resulting in brighter
				lights with more colors. In the 1970s, the iconic National Panasonic
				sign (<strong>Figure 1</strong>) became the biggest neon sign in the
				world.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> During this
				period, Hong Kong
				boasted over 80,000 neon lights, marking the pinnacle of the neon
				industry in the region. Sadly, because of the technology, policy, rent,
				building, commercial mode and so on, the presence of neon signs in Hong
				Kong has been steadily diminishing, since the 2000s. Nowadays the Hong
				Kong government and some organizations and institutions (such as M+
				Museum) are trying to protect and recycle some aging and dismantled neon
				signs, trying to preserve Hong Kong's unique urban symbols and cultural
				heritage.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

				<ol id="chapter-1.2">2. The reasons why Hong Kong's neon signs look like that</ol>
			

			<p>Neon signs aren't exclusive to Hong Kong, but four distinctive
				factors make Hong Kong's neon signs stand out. Firstly, Hong Kong's
				unique architectural environment plays a significant role. In terms of
				architectural functionality, neon signs are most found on the
				traditional Chinese shophouses (tong lau) and the mixed-use buildings.
				For them, the Ground floor is dedicated to commercial activities, while
				the other floors are utilized for both residential and commercial
				purposes. The ongoing mixed-use of buildings results in a continual
				increase of neon signs on different floors. Considering the density of
				buildings, the post-war baby boom and immigration associated with
				internal conflicts led to a substantial increase in the local
				population. As the spaces between buildings decreased and neon signs on
				both sides of structures continued to multiply, so it gave rise to the
				distinctive urban signage landscape in the city.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
					role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
			<p>The second factor is the fiercely competitive business environment of
				that time. As noted in the book <strong><em>Learning from Las
						Vegas</em></strong>,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
					role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> commercial signs, serving a purely
				business function, replaced architecture and became the dominant feature
				of urban spaces. These signs were often unusually large, even bigger
				than the buildings themselves. But the lifespan of signs was notably
				short, akin to industrial products. This brevity wasn't due to wear and
				tear but rather the rapidly changing business landscape. The intense
				competition for space led to a constant stream of new and innovative
				signs. The evolution and turnover of these signs even outpaced that of
				the urban landscape.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
					role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> In Hong Kong's business scene, neon
				signs were crafted to be larger and in more unique shapes to attract
				customers in this dynamic and competitive environment.</p>
			<p>Thirdly, the government at the time lacked specific policies to
				regulate these neon signs. Despite several attempts to establish
				standards for their appearance, permits, and installation, these efforts
				have often been neglected by residents. Concerning aesthetics,
				regulations for various signs and advertisements were already in place
				as early as 1912 under the Advertising Regulation Ordinance.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref"
					id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> However, due to lax enforcement, it
				failed to prevent people from erecting signs without proper
				authorization. The lack of stringent restrictions or improper policy
				enforcement ultimately led to excessive neon signs.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
					role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>



			
				<ol id="chapter-1.3">3. The reasons why the neon signs in Hongkong declined</ol>
			
			<p>There are several reasons why the neon signs in Hongkong declined.
				Firstly, the emergence of new technologies, such as LED lights, which
				offer lower costs and shorter production cycles, is gradually replacing
				neon lights. Secondly, neon signs, once ubiquitous in older districts
				like Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, are facing challenges as traditional
				buildings are dismantled for reconstruction, with new facades often not
				designed to accommodate them. Moreover, the widespread use of the
				internet has broadened advertising methods, reducing the necessity for
				large-scale neon signs, while the surge in online shopping poses a
				challenge to traditional brick-and-mortar retail. In addition,
				policy-wise, the government's implementation of regulations like the
				"Small-scale Engineering Works Control System" in 2010 imposes strict
				criteria for sign placement, leading to the removal of many iconic neon
				signs for violations.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
					role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Finally, escalating costs of
				renting retail spaces in Hong Kong, coupled with uncertainties in
				securing long-term locations, have discouraged businesses from investing
				in elaborate neon signs, even if installed, relocation often entails
				additional expenses.</p>
			<p>Since 2010, around 3,000 signs annually, deemed hazardous by the
				Buildings Department, have been mandated for removal. By now over 90% of
				neon signs have disappeared from the busy streets of Hong Kong.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref"
					id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> In the Yau Tsim Mong District
				alone, from 2015 to November 2018, a total of 803 sign owners committed
				to adhering to the Buildings Department's "Small-scale Engineering Works
				Control System" or had already completed the dismantling process. </p>


			<h2 id="chapter-2">03: The visual secrets behind neon signs in Hong Kong</h2>


			
				<ol id="chapter-2.1">1. The decorative frames of neon signs</ol>
			
			<blockquote>
				<p>Nam Wah Neonlight &amp; Electrical Factory<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
						role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>
					donated a collection of 218 original neon sign designs to the the
					Information Design Lab at Hong Kong Polytechnic University.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref"
						id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> They traced the outlines of each of
					the 175 sign designs and observed their transformation over time to
					analyse the form and frame of the neon signs. In the study of horizontal
					neon signs, there were more irregular arcs and graphic shapes with less
					single shapes and combined shapes in the 1950s (<strong>Figure
						2</strong>), half regular form and half curved shapes in the 1960s
					(<strong>Figure 3</strong>) and signs became simple and clean in the
					1970s (<strong>Figure 4</strong>). As we can see, the aesthetic about
					frames of neon signs transferred from decorative style to more simple
					and functional style.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
						role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

				<ol id="chapter-2.2">2. The colour of neon signs in Hong Kong</ol>
		

			<p>The magic behind the soft and bright colours of neon signs is long
				luminous gas-discharge tubes that contain rarefied neon or other
				gases.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> By infusing
				gases like neon,
				helium, argon, krypton, or xenon and mixing them with a fluorescent
				coating (called a "phosphor") of various colours inside glass tubes, we
				can create a range of colours including red, yellow, blue, white, green,
				and purple.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> As the
				technology developed, more
				precise colours are created. In the design of neon signs, the most
				common colour combinations are complementary, such as red and green, red
				and blue, or yellow and blue. Occasionally, designers (Hu Zhikai, Nam
				Wah Neonlight &amp; Electrical Factory) may introduce one or more
				intermediate colours to the combinations. Among all these colours, red
				stands out as the most used, particularly for headline text.</p>


			
				<ol id="chapter-2.3">3. The stroke of neon signs</ol>
			

			<p>The outlining technique in neon signs is usually divided into
				single-stroke and outline (<strong>Figure 5</strong>). In the
				single-stroke method, the lines follow the structures of the text, while
				the outline traces the outer edges of the characters. Sometimes, to
				highlight the titles in a sign, they will add a single-stroke based on
				the outline (single inline) or repeating the outline (multiple inline).
				In some instances, they fill the outline with horizontally arranged
				light tubes to achieve uniform illumination (parallel lines). However,
				this typically involves more complex craftsmanship and comes with higher
				costs.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
			<p>In Hong Kong, double-stroke is commonly used for titles, whereas
				single-stroke is more often applied to subtitles and additional
				information. The outlining method used for patterns and border
				decorations is more flexible, intended to highlight and emphasize their
				shapes.</p>

						<em>Fig 5. There are five common methods of neon sign character decoration (from left to
							right): single-stroke, outline, single inline, multiple inline and parallel lines.</em>
					</p>

				</figcaption>

			</figure>



			

				
					<ol id="chapter-2.4">4. Graphic symbols in neon signs</ol>
				

				<p>As the business environment becomes increasingly competitive, regular
					text and slogans are no longer sufficient to meet the demands of market
					promotion. Hence, more signs with graphic symbols have emerged. The
					graphic symbols in neon signs typically consist of simple lines and
					shapes, as overly complex images might risk breakage due to the
					excessive twisting of the glass tubes. These graphic symbols can be
					broadly categorized into five types: Animal/Botanical, Characters,
					Objects, Buildings/Scenes, and Geometric forms.</p>
				<p>Typically, the selection of patterns is driven by the shop's function
					or the symbolism the shop wishes to convey. For instance, a store
					specializing in roast duck or roast chicken might straightforwardly
					feature graphic symbols of ducks and chickens. In certain Chinese
					seafood restaurants, you'll often find the use of double carp symbols,
					as carp is seen as the embodiment of a dragon in Chinese mythology. The
					Chinese word for "fish" sounds like "surplus," carrying special
					auspicious significance for business owners and believed to attract good
					fortune.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

			

			

				
					<ol id="chapter-2.5">5. The typefaces of neon signs (Chinese and English)</ol>
				

				<p>The distinctive charm of Hong Kong's neon signs owes much to the
					variety of fonts employed, especially notable in the sign of the city's
					older districts. These fonts span a broad spectrum, including styles
					like clerical script, Northern Wei regular script, Bang script, bold
					regular script, and more, with a notable prevalence of the Northern Wei
					regular script and regular script.</p>
				<p>In many storefront signs and plaques, handwritten calligraphy is
					often executed by Au Kin Kung, a skilled calligrapher adept in various
					styles, with a notable proficiency in Northern Wei regular script. As
					the Northern Wei regular script exhibits a strong stylistic presence,
					slightly modified and innovated strokes are applied by Au Kin Kung to
					enhance clarity and better suit distant recognition when shaping the
					outlines and frames of the characters.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
						role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
				<p>In contrast to the diverse Chinese font styles seen in various signs,
					there are few choices for western fonts, often utilizing sans-serif
					uppercase fonts, cursive, and Roman serif fonts. Western scripts are
					commonly used as subtitles in signs, presenting a distinct contrast to
					the multitudinous Chinese font styles.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"
						role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

			

				
					<ol id="chapter-2.6">6. The composition of information on neon signs</ol>
				

				<p>An important factor influencing sign composition is the method of
					suspension, typically categorized as projecting vertical signs or
					projecting horizontal signs<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
						role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>. In the case of
					projecting vertical signs, text information follows the traditional
					top-to-bottom Chinese format. The store's name takes center stage, often
					occupying the largest portion, while complementary details find
					placement at the top, middle, or bottom of the sign. This additional
					information could encompass business particulars, featured dishes in a
					restaurant, specialized services, or the store's English name, usually
					presented in a smaller font. Details positioned at the bottom are
					typically geared towards pedestrians, whereas those at the top or middle
					sections are strategically placed for optimal visibility by drivers from
					a distance<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a>.
				</p>
				<p>For projecting horizontal signs, the reading logic is from left to
					right. The store's name commands the majority of the sign, and
					supplementary information is typically positioned at the top or bottom,
					occasionally on the left side for better visibility by pedestrians.</p>

			

			<h2 id="chapter-3">04: The visual culture of neon signs in Hong Kong</h2>

			
				
					<ol id="chapter-3.1">1. The aesthetic of cyberpunk</ol>
				

				<p>The term "cyberpunk" originated from the science fiction literary
					movement that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s, culminating in the 1980s.
					Coined by science fiction writer Bruce Bethke<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"
						role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a>
					in 1980, it was popularized by William Gibson's novel "Neuromancer"<a href="#fn28"
						class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> in 1984, establishing a
					new genre
					within science fiction literature. With its diverse visual impact,
					including neon lights on streets, iconic advertisements and towering
					skyscrapers introduced a captivating visual aesthetic to the genre.</p>
				<p>Cyberpunk literature is imbued with a strong sense of
					anti-utopianism<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"
						role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> and pessimism, portraying a future
					society where the gap between the rich and the poor widens incessantly,
					and where the entire social fabric is saturated with oppression of human
					nature.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> In
					Hong Kong's history, the Kowloon
					Walled City stands out with its staggering residential density, aimless
					urban development, and proliferation of illicit businesses. There are so
					many similarities between the visual image of the Kowloon Walled City
					and the world depicted in cyberpunk literature, thus it becomes
					quintessential archetype of urban architecture within cyberpunk
					narratives.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>
				</p>
				<p>In addition to novels depicting the cyber world, films and television
					series have more directly imprinted this visual imagery into the public
					consciousness, for instance, the 1982 film "Blade Runner"<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref"
						id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>,
					the 2017 sequel "Blade Runner 2049"<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"
						role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>, the 2008 film

				<p>The 1995 animated film "Ghost in the Shell"<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"
						role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a>
					deepened the association between Hong Kong and cyberpunk. Director
					Mamoru Oshii envisioned Asia as the vanguard of the future world's
					development in the 21st century, with Hong Kong serving as a template
					for emulation by other cities of the time. Thus, he selected Hong Kong
					as the blueprint for the futuristic metropolis "New Port City" depicted
					in the movie.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a>
				</p>
				<p>After numerous visits to observe Hong Kong's streets and alleys and
					sketching drafts, Mamoru Oshii meticulously crafted the details of "New
					Port City" portrayed in the film. The result was a portrayal so rich in
					detail that one could almost instantly recognize Hong Kong. The sight of
					massive planes flying low over densely populated residential buildings
					was inspired by the daily scenes near the former Kai Tak Airport in
					Kowloon City<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>.
					Iconic Hong Kong street trams were
					depicted as yachts in the animation, while the narrow streets
					transformed into pitch-black waterways, creating a surreal yet
					hauntingly authentic depiction of a dystopian urban landscape.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref"
						id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
				<p>The 2017 live-action adaptation of "Ghost in the Shell"<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref"
						id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> remained true to Mamoru Oshii's
					vision by shooting on location in Hong Kong. The film showcased
					recognizable landmarks such as the circular footbridge in Causeway Bay,
					the lively streets of Yau Ma Tei, and the towering skyscrapers along
					both sides of Victoria Harbour. With the addition of CGI effects, Hong
					Kong was heightened into a mesmerizing spectacle, solidifying its status
					as a quintessential reference point in Western cyberpunk works. Neon
					signs, in particular, continued to serve as iconic elements of cyberpunk
					visual aesthetics in the film.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"

					<ol id="chapter-3.2">2. The neon signs’ cultural significance to citizens in Hong Kong</ol>
				

				<p>The older generation of Hong Kong residents, who have witnessed the
					evolution of neon lights from the 1950s to the present, hold a deep
					emotional connection to these luminous symbols. For them, neon signs are
					not just a cultural symbol of Hong Kong but also a nostalgic memory of
					their childhood that they can never return to. However, since the 2000s,
					due to the aging of many neon signs, policies from the Buildings
					Department mandated the removal of many still-operational neon signs.<a href="#fn41"
						class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> This was because aging
					signs posed
					risks of loosening and falling, creating safety hazards. The removed
					aging neon signs are often sent to conservation organizations like the
					M+ Museum<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a>,
					where they are transformed into
					museum artifacts for historical research and public appreciation.
					However, as they transition from street displays to museum exhibits,
					these once-functional neon signs now remain perpetually dark. The
					vibrant and colorful images of neon signs that once illuminated the
					streets on those memorable nights have vanished from people's sights.<a href="#fn43"
						class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
				<p><em>For Xie Zhenyuan, the six-meter-high neon sign of "Tai Tung
						Bakery" once symbolized the long history of this old brand. His shop
						endured the tumultuous years when Hong Kong was under Japanese
						occupation during World War II. At his age of 90, Xie Zhenyuan witnessed
						the removal of the neon sign in his store in 2022. He was informed that
						the sign was too large and aging, failing to meet regulations. "That
						sign has been hanging for over 50 years, weathered typhoons, and never
						stop working," he remarked. He continues to visit the shop daily. He
						missed the neon sign. To comply with the government's demands, Xie
						Zhenyuan plans to install a smaller sign for the bakery, despite the
						hefty cost of HK$620,000. To ensure the business is passed down to the
						fourth generation, his son has returned from Australia to Hong Kong. "I
						hope Hong Kong remains vibrant," expressed Xie Zhenyuan. "I want this
						shop to embody the essence of Hong Kong for people."</em><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref"
						id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
				<p>From this interview, we discern the profound attachment of the older
					generation to Hong Kong's neon signs. Meanwhile, the younger generation
					of Hong Kongers, influenced by early films, the few remaining neon signs
					on the streets, and the impact of their parents, perceive a condensed
					history of neon signs.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"
						role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> Due to its colonial past under
					British rule and its current status under Chinese governance, Hong Kong
					is in a complex cultural context. Hong Kongers are eagerly seeking their
					own special identity, distinct from that of Britain or mainland China,
					amidst this backdrop.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"
						role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> Therefore, neon signs, as cultural
					vessels, offer a sense of self-identification and harbor nostalgic
					sentiments for many Hong Kongers. Despite various challenges leading to
					the decline of neon signs, most Hong Kongers are keen to preserve and
					uphold this cultural identity.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"
						role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a></p>

			
				
					<ol id="chapter-3.3">3. Sustainable development of neon signs, policy management, and technology
						iteration</ol>
				

				<p>When faced with unchangeable policies, the most effective means of
					preserving these cultural treasures is through conservation (Bao Yu).<a href="#fn48"
						class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> Many conservation
					projects have
					been improving over time. Conservationists not only meticulously
					document the visual and textual aspects but also analyze and deconstruct
					the history of each neon sign, which may include analyzing fonts (many
					of them are handwritten by calligraphy masters, making each sign
					unique), color schemes, and materials. They then had these analyses and
					studies, make them open for people to study and research.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref"
						id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
				<p>The Information Design Lab at the department of design, Hong Kong
					Polytechnic University, has collected numerous neon sign sketches dating
					from the 1950s to the 1970s. Utilizing special printing processes, they
					have compiled image collections of neon signs showing different effects
					during the day and night. Readers can utilize the UV light included with
					the books to observe the neon signs at night. Additionally, they have
					published a variety of neon sign collection books.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"
						role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
				<p>In addition to conservation and various cultural product displays,
					there has been a development of neon signs in the world of electronic
					gaming, which is currently in its golden age. The scale of the gaming
					industry is immense, surpassing even the combined popularity of
					mainstream film and music industries. It is currently one of the hottest
					forms of popular media. There are approximately 150 electronic games set
					in Hong Kong globally (<strong>Figure 6</strong>). Hugh Davies explores
					the portrayal of Hong Kong in gaming. Many scenes that have disappeared
					from the real world of Hong Kong are revived in the virtual gaming
					world, such as Kowloon Walled City and some dismantled neon signs. In
					the virtual world, Hong Kong and neon signs exist in another form in
					people's minds.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"

				<p>The government organizes various activities related to neon signs,
					such as inviting different artists to create neon-themed works,
					organizing neon-themed exhibitions, and creating neon sign maps, all
					aimed at maintaining the cultural influence of neon signs in the hearts
					of citizens. In recent years, many local companies, as well as numerous
					independent restaurants, bars, and fashion brands, have been committed
					to providing a new home for neon signs, transitioning them from the
					streets to indoor spaces and transforming them into genuine works of
					decorative art.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"

			<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

			<p>Neon signs were introduced to Hong Kong from the West, and due to
				Hong Kong's unique geographical location and architectural features,
				they gave rise to a one-of-a-kind neon landscape in the world.
				Flourishing amidst the fiercely competitive business environment of the
				time and the absence of policy constraints, neon lights grew
				unrestrained. This process fostered a generation of skilled artisans to
				meet the high demand. Through continuous iterations and developments in
				both technology and aesthetics, more beautiful and unique neon signs
				were created. These neon signs accompanied a generation of people
				growing up from the 1950s to the 2000s, becoming cultural symbols in
				their hearts and nostalgic memories. Concurrently, due to the vibrant
				development of Hong Kong cinema during this period, neon signs became a
				special scene and symbol in visual culture. Additionally, due to the
				portrayal in dystopian science fiction novels, the imagery of Hong
				Kong's neon signs represented an imagination of the future world, with
				cyberpunk becoming inseparably linked to Hong Kong's neon signs. During
				this period, Hong Kong's neon signs acquired more cultural
				definitions.</p>
			<p>However, after 2000, due to the iteration of new technologies and the
				safety risks posed by aging neon signs, tens of thousands of neon lights
				were forcibly removed and became exhibits in museums. In this period,
				Hong Kong citizens, who were immersed in a blend of Eastern and Western
				cultures, urgently needed to find symbols and voices that belonged to
				their own city. Thus, neon lights became a symbol for Hong Kong people
				to find their identity and belonging. Despite the irreversible trend of
				decline in neon lights, Hong Kong citizens continue to strive to protect
				their cultural identity symbol—the neon lights. Through conservation
				efforts, research and analysis, organizing neon light-related
				activities, producing peripheral cultural products, and recreating
				scenes in numerous electronic games, the neon lights of Hong Kong
				continue to shine brightly in people's hearts, never to be
				extinguished.</p>
