			<h2 id="Abstract">Abstract</h2>

			<p>
				During the 4 years in KABK, I came to the realization that my passion lies in the realm of type and
				moving image. The vivid imagery of Hong Kong neon signs adorned with a fusion of illustrative Chinese
				calligraphy and Latin words, illuminating the urban night in various captivating ways, constantly
				occupies my mind. I wanted to understand the hidden meanings behind color, symbols, patterns, moving
				methods of neon signs in Hong Kong. I wanted to know why, when neon signs are so highly valued in Hong
				Kong, the craft is still fading. I wanted to study why the neon signs can make a big influence in visual
				culture.
			</p>

			<p>
				The neon sign in Hong Kong is one of the most iconic sceneries around the world, leaving a profound
				visual imprint with their dazzling and colourful presence on people.
			</p>

			<p>
				This thesis delves into the developmental history of Hong Kong's neon signs, examining why these neon
				signs have evolved into a distinctive visual culture globally recognized from both visual and cultural
				perspectives. Additionally, the research delves into the intricate craftsmanship underlying neon sign
				production, the rationale governing visual synthesis, the interplay between Hong Kong's identity and
				neon signs, and the consequential cultural influence wielded by these neon signs.
			</p>

			<p>
				Methodologically, the inquiry is grounded in a meticulous examination of specific urban neon signs
				within Hong Kong's cityscape, contextualized against pertinent policy developments, and supplemented by
				a synthesis of scholarly works and research literature.
			</p>

			<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

			<p>Neon signs are crafted from glass tubes filled with gas. Skilled artisans heat and manipulate the glass,
				creating diverse shapes that illuminate as the gas reacts to electrical energy. This soft and dynamic
				glow enjoyed widespread popularity in 20th-century Hong Kong. While neon lights originally hailed from
				the West, Hong Kong's colonial past facilitated the integration of this technology. Over several decades
				of evolution, Hong Kong's neon signs have transformed into a cultural hallmark. These distinctive, large
				neon signs, nestled within the unique urban landscape of Hong Kong, boast varied sizes, shapes, font
				combinations, and a spectrum of colours. Their rhythmic animated displays and the gentle radiance of
				neon lights collectively produce a highly identifiable visual spectacle. This iconic cityscape has found
				its way into numerous films, photography projects, and visual arts, becoming a symbol that captures the
				vibrancy, opulence, confidence, and fragility of the modern urban experience. Simultaneously, within the
				realm of cyberpunk sci-fi, this visual motif appears as an element in depicting a future dystopian city,
				offering the unique visual image – neon signs diverse interpretations and cultural significance.</p>

			<p>As new technologies, such as LED lights, emerge with lower costs and shorter production cycles, neon
				signs are gradually being supplanted. Despite intentional governmental efforts to preserve them, neon
				signs still face an inevitable trend of decline. In the ongoing process of urban modernization, striking
				a balance between the imperative to protect these cultural artifacts and the developmental need of the
				city becomes particularly crucial.</p>

			<p>To better achieve this goal, it is essential to understand the emotional and cultural connections between
				the citizens living under these neon signs and these iconic displays. From an economic perspective,
				exploring how the presence and evolution of neon signs impact Hong Kong's socio-economic landscape is
				vital. This exploration may encompass their roles in attracting tourism, shaping the distinctive
				characteristics of different communities, and fostering the overall economic vitality of the city.</p>

			<p>From an urban planning standpoint, it is crucial to analyse the role of neon signs in city planning and
				design. Consider how neon signs contribute to the visual identity of various regions and explore
				existing regulations or policies governing the integration of neon signages with the cityscape. Only
				through a comprehensive consideration of the myriad real-world factors influencing neon signs can we
				hope to better protect and ensure the enduring sustainability of these beautiful neon signs.</p>

					<h3 id="chapter-1">1. The background of neon signs in Hong Kong</h2>
				</summary>

				<p>Neon light was discovered in 1893 by Serbian American inventor Nikola Tesla, but he didn't file for a
					patent. William Ramsay found that rare gases, when electrified in discharge lamps, produce distinct
					and vibrant colours. Later Georges Claude tweaked the design originally crafted by Daniel McFarlan
					Moore, ironed out some practical engineering issues, and secured a patent for the neon light in
					1910. After flourishing in western nations, neon lights sailed across the seas and found their way
					to China. The first neon sign was installed at the Shanghai Central Hostel (上海中央大旅社) in China. It’s
					made by the Shanghai Far East Chemistry Company (上海远东化学制造厂) in 1927. During the decade, the neon
					industry in Shanghai thrived, expanding across the country, and reaching coastal cities. Yet, due to
					the political turmoil sparked by the Japanese invasion of China in 1937 and the ensuing internal
					conflicts, numerous neon light manufacturers moved their operations from Shanghai to Hong Kong. This
					shift involved the transfer of capital, human resources, skills, and knowledge. In the 1950s, Hong
					Kong's neon industry was booming, with a vibrant market showcasing intricate neon designs. Neon
					technology had advanced considerably progress, enabling the creation of complex shapes, resulting in
					brighter lights with more colors. In the 1970s, the iconic National Panasonic sign (Figure 1) became
					the biggest neon sign in the world. During this period, Hong Kong boasted over 80,000 neon lights,
					marking the pinnacle of the neon industry in the region. Sadly, because of the technology, policy,
					rent, building, commercial mode and so on, the presence of neon signs in Hong Kong has been steadily
					diminishing, since the 2000s. Nowadays the Hong Kong government and some organizations and
					institutions (such as M+ Museum) are trying to protect and recycle some aging and dismantled neon
					signs, trying to preserve Hong Kong's unique urban symbols and cultural heritage. </p>

					<h3 id="chapter-1">2. The reasons why Hong Kong's neon signs look like that</h2>
				</summary>

				<p>Neon signs aren't exclusive to Hong Kong, but four distinctive factors make Hong Kong's neon signs
					stand out. Firstly, Hong Kong's unique architectural environment plays a significant role. In terms
					of architectural functionality, neon signs are most found on the traditional Chinese shophouses
					(tong lau) and the mixed-use buildings. For them, the Ground floor is dedicated to commercial
					activities, while the other floors are utilized for both residential and commercial purposes. The
					ongoing mixed-use of buildings results in a continual increase of neon signs on different floors.
					Considering the density of buildings, the post-war baby boom and immigration associated with
					internal conflicts led to a substantial increase in the local population. As the spaces between
					buildings decreased and neon signs on both sides of structures continued to multiply, so it gave
					rise to the distinctive urban signage landscape in the city. </p>

				<p>The second factor is the fiercely competitive business environment of that time. As noted in the book
					Learning from Las Vegas, commercial signs, serving a purely business function, replaced architecture
					and became the dominant feature of urban spaces. These signs were often unusually large, even bigger
					than the buildings themselves. But the lifespan of signs was notably short, akin to industrial
					products. This brevity wasn't due to wear and tear but rather the rapidly changing business
					landscape. The intense competition for space led to a constant stream of new and innovative signs.
					The evolution and turnover of these signs even outpaced that of the urban landscape. In Hong Kong's
					business scene, neon signs were crafted to be larger and in more unique shapes to attract customers
					in this dynamic and competitive environment.</p>

				<p>Thirdly, the government at the time lacked specific policies to regulate these neon signs. Despite
					several attempts to establish standards for their appearance, permits, and installation, these
					efforts have often been neglected by residents. Concerning aesthetics, regulations for various signs
					and advertisements were already in place as early as 1912 under the Advertising Regulation
					Ordinance. However, due to lax enforcement, it failed to prevent people from erecting signs without
					proper authorization. The lack of stringent restrictions or improper policy enforcement ultimately
					led to excessive neon signs.</p>

				<summary>
					<h3 id="chapter-1">3. The reason why the neon signs in HK declined</h2>
				</summary>

				<p>1. Technical aspect: With the emergence of new technologies such as LED lights, which offer lower
					costs and shorter production cycles, neon lights are gradually being replaced.</p>

				<p>2. Architectural aspect: Neon signs are commonly found in old districts like Hong Kong Island and
					Kowloon, where buildings are aging and undergoing reconstruction. Traditional Chinese shophouses
					(tong lau) are being dismantled, but the facades of new buildings are not designed to accommodate
					neon signs.</p>

				<p>3. Commercial mode aspect: The widespread use of the internet has broadened advertising methods,
					reducing the need for large-scale neon signs. Furthermore, the surge in online shopping has
					presented a challenge to traditional brick-and-mortar retail.</p>

				<p>4. Policy aspect: In 2010, the government implemented comprehensive regulations "Small-scale
					Engineering Works Control System". These regulations stipulate that signs cannot extend more than
					4.2 meters from the external wall and must be at least 3.5 meters above the ground. Signs erected
					without approval from the Buildings Department or failing to meet these criteria are considered
					violations, resulting in removal orders. Iconic neon signs, like the Sammy's Kitchen cow-shaped neon
					sign erected since 1977 in Sai Wan, had to be taken down.</p>

				<p>5. Rent aspect: The escalating costs of renting retail spaces in Hong Kong, combined with the
					uncertainty of securing the same location long-term, have discouraged businesses from investing in
					elaborate signage. Even if a sign is installed, the prospect of relocation involves additional
					expenses.</p>
					
				<p>Since 2010, around 3,000 signs annually, deemed hazardous by the Buildings Department, have been
					mandated for removal. By now over 90% of neon signs have disappeared from the busy streets of Hong
					Kong. In the Yau Tsim Mong District alone, from 2015 to November 2018, a total of 803 sign owners
					committed to adhering to the Buildings Department's "Small-scale Engineering Works Control System"
					or had already completed the dismantling process.</p>
